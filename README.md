## üìö What motivates me
I love stories - in games, books and software. I enjoy story-driven games like Elden Ring, Lies of P, Dark Souls and Ghost of Tsushima, and I read epic fantasy novels. That love for storytelling influences how I design systems and user experiences.

## üéÆ Fun fact
I prefer story-based games over online FPS. I enjoy exploring narratives, world-building and emergent experiences - the same curiosity feeds my projects.
